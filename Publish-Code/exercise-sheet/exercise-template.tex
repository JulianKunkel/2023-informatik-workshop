\task{Hide your secrets}{10}

	\subsection*{Task Preparation}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item fork \href{https://github.com/marc-philipp-knechtle/2023-informatik-workshop-publish-code}{2023-informatik-workshop-publish-code}
			\item (optional, just required if you want to run the code) create a venv inside this repository
			% solution: python3 -m venv .venv
			\item (optional ...) activate the venv
			% solution: source .venv/bin/activate
			\item (optional ...) install all dependencies
			% solution: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
			\item download the \texttt{bfg repo cleaner} \href{https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/}{here}
			% solution: wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar && mv bfg-1.14.0.jar bfg.jar
		\end{enumerate}

	\subsection*{Removing secrets}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Remove the \texttt{ssh} key from the history using the \texttt{bfg repo cleaner}. You can just remove the private key or remove the private key as well as the public key.
			% solution:
			% 	* remove the ssh key with rm (simply delete the file)
			% 	* commit this, but the git show will still show the ssh key
			% 	* run the bfg repo cleaner on this file: java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files id_ed25519
			% 	* run the command the bfg repo cleaner recommends (git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive)
			% 	* git show <commithash> should now result in an error
				\begin{itemize}
					\item 	You can verify this by running: \texttt{git show <commithash>}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Find the password which was used for the request in \texttt{fetch-weather-data.py}
			% solution: 
				% find the passphrase with git log
			\item Remove this passphrase from the history using the \texttt{bfg repo cleaner}
			% solution: 
				% add password which was viewed in the previous exercise to passwords.txt
				% java -jar bfg.jar --replace-text passwords.txt
				% git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
				% git show should now show ***REMOVED*** instead of the passphrase
				\begin{itemize}
					\item 	You can verify this by running: \texttt{git show <commithash>}
				\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}

	\begin{hints}
  		\item 	You can have a look at the commit history to find the passphrase which was accidentally commited.
  		% solution: git log lets you view the commits with the corresponding commit message. the commit messages are pretty indicative
  		\item 	You can have a look at the \texttt{.bfg-report} directory for a detailed analysis on the bfg process
  		\item 	If you want to push your changes to the upstream, you have to force-push it
  		\item 	Have a look at the bfg repo cleaner examples ;)
	\end{hints}

\task{CI Pipeline using Github Actions}{30}
	This task is about setting up a CI/CD pipeline for an open source project. You can do this for any project you like or simply for the \href{https://github.com/marc-philipp-knechtle/2023-informatik-workshop-publish-code}{2023-informatik-workshop-publish-code} repository.
	\subsection*{Choose your project and fork it}
		After you have selected an open-source project that you want to set up a CI pipeline for, create a fork of the project. This will create a copy of the project in your account.

	\subsection*{Create actions for the forked project}
		Start by adding the \href{https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart}{quickstart github action} to the project. This action provides some gathered information about this project.
		\newline
		You can write some additional actions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Check if the code adhears to the style guidelines of the project (\texttt{pylint})
			\item 	Calculate the test coverage
			\item 	Run all the tests
			\item 	Trigger the build process of the project
			\item 	Push the build artifacts to some hosting solution
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Create a CI pieline = workflow for the project you forked} 
		The pipeline should contain multiple actions and could for example end with publishing the newest build artifact on GitHub. Review the build status and logs of the newly created workflow.
	
	\subsection*{Make changes to the project and commit those changes validating the CI pipeline}
		These changes could be something small like for example refactoring some variables. Review the CI/CD process logs again to check if your workflow ran successfully. 
		
	\begin{hints}
		\item You can view the pipeline inside the \href{https://github.com/marc-philipp-knechtle/2023-informatik-workshop-publish-code}{2023-informatik-workshop-publish-code} repository. 
		\item The workflows are stored inside the \texttt{project-dir/.github/workflows} directory

	Understanding the branching mechanism in git really helps during the development process. The tutorials on \url{https://learngitbranching.js.org/} visualize the internal functionality. You can do some of the tutorials as an exercise.
